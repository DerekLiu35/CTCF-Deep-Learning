# CTCF-Deep-Learning

CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization. Identifying CTCF binding sites can provide valuable insights into the functional elements of the genome. We explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict CTCF binding sites in the genome.
